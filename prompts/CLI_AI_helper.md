# Guide to Building an Effective CLI AI Assistant

## 1. Purpose Clarity
- **Define Capabilities**: Clearly outline the assistant's abilities and limitations.
- **Help Messages**: Offer concise, informative help messages via `--help` or `-h`.
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Ensure outputs are clear and unambiguous.

## 2. User-Friendly Interface
- **Simplicity**: Maintain a simple, intuitive interface.
- **Natural Commands**: Use natural language for commands and options.
  - **Example**: `ask_GPT -f file.txt "Analyze this code"` instead of complex syntax.
- **Usage Examples**: Include examples in help messages for typical use cases.

## 3. Error Handling
- **Input Validation**: Check inputs and provide clear error messages.
  - **Example**: For invalid file paths, return: "Error: File not found. Please verify the path."
- **Stability**: Prevent crashes from invalid commands or inputs.

## 4. Flexibility
- **Input Variability**: Accept text queries, file inputs, and stdin reading (e.g., `cat file.txt | ask_GPT`).
- **Configuration Options**: Support settings through environment variables or command-line arguments.

## 5. Responsiveness
- **Quick Feedback**: Minimize response times.
- **Processing Indicators**: Inform users of longer processing times for extensive tasks.

## 6. Transparency
- **Activity Insights**: Show backend processes when useful (e.g., "Querying GPT..." or "Analyzing 'input.txt'...").
- **Configuration Visibility**: Allow users to view (but not expose) sensitive settings like API keys.

## 7. Customization
- **User Preferences**: Enable customization of output verbosity (`--verbose`), prompts, API parameters, and model settings.

## 8. Security
- **Protect Sensitive Data**: Avoid revealing sensitive information in logs or error messages.
- **Input Sanitization**: Guard against exploits through proper input checks.
- **Data Handling Disclosure**: Clearly explain data processing practices to users.

## 9. Output Quality
- **Readable Formatting**: Ensure terminal outputs are easy to read, with options for JSON or YAML formats for scripting.
- **Consistency and Actionability**: Provide uniform and useful responses.

## 10. Integrability
- **CLI Ecosystem Compatibility**: Design for seamless integration with other CLI tools, supporting piping and redirection.
- **Script-Friendly Outputs**: Offer outputs that can be easily parsed by scripts.

## 11. Accessibility
- **Inclusive Design**: Cater to both novices and experts with straightforward commands and advanced options.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide clear, accessible help documentation.

## 12. Proactive Assistance
- **Error Correction Suggestions**: Offer fixes for common mistakes (e.g., "Did you mean '--file' instead of '--flie'?").
- **Insightful Recommendations**: Based on queries, suggest enhancements like code optimization tips.

## 13. Extendability
- **Open for Extensions**: Facilitate the addition of new features or integrations by developers.
- **Well-Documented Codebase**: Ensure clear documentation for easy maintenance and extension.

### Example Usage

```bash
$ ask_GPT "What's the square root of 256?"
Response: 16

$ ask_GPT -f "example.py" "How can I improve this code?"
Processing file: example.py
Response:
- Add type hints for better readability.
- Avoid global variables to simplify debugging.
- Refactor `calculate_sum` for improved modularity.

$ cat large_text.txt | ask_GPT "Summarize this text"
Processing input from stdin...
Response: Highlights the role of CLI assistants in boosting developer efficiency.
