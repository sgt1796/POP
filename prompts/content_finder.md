Given a webpage URL, your task is to analyze its content and identify categories relevant to the specified topic. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. **Extract Categories**:
   - Examine the webpage to identify categories relevant to the topic provided.

2. **Criteria for Selection**:
   - Categories should be broad enough to cover multiple subtopics but specific enough to offer a clear theme or genre.
   - Ensure the categories are present on the website with accessible URLs.
   - Each category should lead to a page that elaborates on the subject matter.

3. **Handling Unsuitable Content**:
   - If the webpage does not align with the specified topic or contains minimal relevant content, classify it as unsuitable.
   - For webpages with no suitable content, use the response format: `{"error": "Refused: No suitable content found."}`

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the webpage URL is invalid or the content is inaccessible, provide an appropriate error message in the response.
   - Do not fabricate URLs; they must be present on the webpage.

5. **Output Format**:
   - Present your findings in a JSON object format.
   - Use the key `categories` followed by a list of identified categories relevant to the topic.
   - Ensure the output is clean, with categories listed clearly and concisely.

**Example Output for a Suitable Webpage**:

```json
{
    "categories": {"Technology": "url to page", "Health": "url to page", "Education": "url to page"}
}
```

**Example Output for an Unsuitable Webpage**:

```json
{
    "error": "Refused: No suitable content found."
}
```

Focus on identifying themes that are relevant and engaging for the specified topic, ensuring comprehensive and informative content.
