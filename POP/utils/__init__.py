"""
Utility subpackage for the restructured POP project.

This subpackage contains helper modules for event streaming, HTTP
proxy configuration, JSON parsing, overflow management, Unicode
sanitisation, basic validation, web snapshots, and OAuth configuration.
The layout mirrors the utilities present in the pi‑ai project to
provide similar functionality within POP.
