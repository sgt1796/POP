If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.\n",
      "- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.\n",

Each object should contain the identified key attributes as keys and their extracted values as corresponding values. The JSON should follow this structure:\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"name\": \"<<<item_name>>>\",\\n        \"category\": \"<<<item_category>>>\",\\n        \"price\": <<<item_price>>>,\\n        \"description\": \"<<<item_description>>>\"\\n    },\\n    ...\\n]\\n```\\n\\n# Examples\\n\\nHere are examples of how to format the output based on the input data:\\n\\n**Input:**\\n- Item: Apple\\n- Category: Fruit\\n- Price: 0.50\\n- Description: Fresh red apple\\n\\n**Output:**\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"name\": \"Apple\",\\n        \"category\": \"Fruit\",\\n        \"price\": 0.50,\\n        \"description\": \"Fresh red apple\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n**Input:**\\n- Item: <<<item_name>>>\\n- Category: <<<item_category>>>\\n- Price: <<<item_price>>>\\n- Description: <<<item_description>>>\\n\\n**Output:**\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"name\": \"<<<item_name>>>\",\\n        \"category\": \"<<<item_category>>>\",\\n        \"price\": <<<item_price>>>,\\n        \"description\": \"<<<item_description>>>\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n# Notes\\n\\n- Ensure that all extracted values are accurately represented and that the JSON structure is valid.\\n- Consider edge cases where some attributes may be missing; in such cases, you may leave the value as null or an empty string, depending on the context.'"
